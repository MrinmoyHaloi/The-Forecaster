# The Forecaster

A weather forecasting app that uses the openweathermap api to gather the weather info and the unsplash api to get the location images.

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

don't forget to rename the .env.example file to .env and update your api keys
